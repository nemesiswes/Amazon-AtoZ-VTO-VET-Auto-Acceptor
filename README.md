Tired of not getting VTO or VET? Well now you can get all the VTO or VET. 

I made this using the TamperMonkey Extension for Chrome. You should be able to get this working in Firefox using Grease monkey with little modification. 
Also it is possible to remotly activate or deactivate the script. You will just need a Home server, in my case I just used XAMPP for Windows.

1. Make sure you input your Employee id where specified in script
2. Add home server url if you set that up or comment out the server check code.
3. Edit sound url or comment out all sound clip code in various places.
4. Your going to also need a Mouse Auto Clicker, you need to make sure it clicks the page say every 250ms to make sure the page registers a click,  just have it click a non-clickable area of the page.
5. You might also want to get a Page refresher extension for chrome that refreshes every 90 seconds or so in case of page errros that prevent the script from auto refreshing page. Its a wierd bug I never fixed. Just stays on a white page doing nothing.

You can also mess around with timings for page refresh to make it faster, slower etc..

Enjoy your VTO!
