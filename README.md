# Amazon-AtoZ-VTO-VET-Auto-Acceptor
Tired of not getting VTO or VET? Well now you can get all the VTO or VET. 

I made this using the TamperMonkey Extension for Chrome. You should be able to get this working in Firefox using Grease monkey with little modification. 
Also it is possible to remotly activate or deactivate the script. You will just need a Home server, in my case I just used XAMPP for Windows.

I no longer have access to the AtoZ site, so I will no longer be able to change this script and test it.
